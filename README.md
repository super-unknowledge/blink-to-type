# blink-to-type
Blink to type from a file using OpenCV.

**TODO:**
1. clean up code and housekeeping
	- isolate functions
	- change names that feel weird
	- slightly better documentation
2. fix relative paths so code can be run from outermost directory
3. write installation guide
4. write a fun lil write up
	- eventually a blog post
4.5. e-beg for a job
5. optional: add typing velocity feature

## Installation
1. pip install requirements
2. create Models directory and curl from dlib
